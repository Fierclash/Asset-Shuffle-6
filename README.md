# Asset-Shuffle-6
 Created for Rebel Game Dev Club of UNLV

Theme: Map Design
Description:
    This Asset Shuffle contains an outline for map design. The player controls a rolling ball than can move in four directions in a 3D environment. Given a starting platform and an finishing platform, game developers are encouraged to design a unique map for this project and possibly incorporate unique platforming mechanics.
